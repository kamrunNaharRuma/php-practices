# Why do I need a server for my PHP pages?

Your browser can not run PHP code like HTML, CS, JavaScript. Hence you need a server that has PHP installed on it, that will run the code. And PHP was designed to be a server-side language whereas HTML, CSS, JS are client side languages. Hence PHP needs a server.
