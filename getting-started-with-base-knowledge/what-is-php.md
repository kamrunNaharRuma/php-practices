# PHP

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.

PHP is a powerful, behind the scene scripting language that your visitors won't see.

When someone visits your PHP webpage, your web server processes the PHP code. It then sees which parts it needs to show to visitors (content and pictures) and hides the other stuff (file operations, math calculations etc) then translates your PHP into HTMl. After the translation into HTML, it sends the webpage to your visitor's web browser.
