# How does Apache work with PHP?

After Apache decides that this is a PHP file, it gives it to the PHP interpreter. When PHP receives the file it reads through it and executes any PHP code it can find. When Apache geth the output back from PHP, it sends that output back to a browser hich renders it to the screen.
